# Django Framework Architecture Manifesto

TLDR (Too Long, Didn't Read)
A highly available Django framework deployed across multiple OpenStack regions, using F5 GTM/LTM for load balancing. Built with traditional web technologies (Bootstrap 5, JavaScript, NO React), featuring LDAP integration and SSO. Emphasis on reusable components, standardized images, and API-first integrations. Supports dark/light modes, comprehensive monitoring, and cross-team development with robust documentation. Data-centric approach using local databases over external API calls, with Redis caching consideration. Includes development, UAT, and production environments with full local development support for Mac/Windows.
