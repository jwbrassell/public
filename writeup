### **Portal Modernization: Current State, Strategic Shift, and Key Decisions**

#### **Current State of the Portal Infrastructure**

Our current portal infrastructure, while functional, faces significant challenges:

1. **Access Management**:  
   - Universal root access leads to a lack of accountability and traceability for changes.  
   - Files and directories are created without clear ownership, making troubleshooting and maintenance difficult.

2. **Accountability and Auditing**:  
   - Actions are performed as root, leaving no records of who did what, making debugging and auditing virtually impossible.

3. **Reduced Maintenance Resources**:  
   - Previously, a team (Justin, Jeremy, Angad, Matt) managed the portal.  
   - Now, only Justin is responsible, increasing the burden without streamlined tools to support operations.

4. **Stack and Data Handling**:  
   - The portal relies on AdminLTE, Bootstrap 4, and Apache for its interface and server-side logic.  
   - Data is handled via static JSON/CSV files transferred over SFTP, limiting scalability and flexibility.

5. **Backups**:  
   - File-based backups with **lsyncd** offer basic protection but lack robustness for high availability or disaster recovery.

6. **User Management**:  
   - Creating and managing users is a manual, cumbersome process, with no centralized authentication or granular access control.

# **White Paper: Modernizing the Portal Infrastructure**

---

## **Abstract**

This white paper outlines the challenges faced, solutions implemented, and decisions made during the modernization of a legacy portal infrastructure. Initially designed to support multiple users and teams, the portal architecture encountered significant challenges due to a lack of documentation, standards, and team resources. In response, a simplified and scalable framework leveraging modern tools and best practices was developed, designed not only to solve immediate issues but to reduce technical debt and ensure long-term maintainability.

## **Background**

In the spring of this year, the original portal infrastructure was built to support internal operations and external teams. This stack relied on:

- **AdminLTE** for the frontend.
- **Bootstrap 4** for design.
- **Apache (httpd)** for web hosting.
- **Static JSON and CSV files** for data handling.

This system worked effectively when a dedicated team (Justin, Jeremy, Angad, and Matt) was available to maintain it. However, the following challenges arose:

1. **Team Reorganization**:  
   By the end of summer, the team was split among other groups, leaving a single individual (Justin) to maintain the system while assuming a new role and managing new responsibilities.

2. **Lack of Documentation and Standards**:  
   The original architecture had no documentation or coding standards, making maintenance challenging and time-consuming.  

3. **Expanding Scope**:  
   As new portals were built for additional teams, the complexity of the infrastructure grew, and the absence of documentation and team resources made managing this expansion increasingly unsustainable.

4. **Technical Debt**:  
   Ownership of all technical debt fell onto one person. Coupled with the new responsibilities of the role, maintaining and upgrading the stack became untenable.
